# SudokuGenerator
Python 3.x code that prettily prints out a random valid Sudoku of specified size

Currently one of the symetry scrambles (rotational) is non-functional, and has been disabled.

Features planned (don't hold your breath): 
  Producing an actual uniquely solveable sudoku puzzle (with varying difficulty) from the resulting grid.
  Adding Non-rectangular number puzzles (eg. 7x7, which would require septaminos instead of boxes).
  Other things as I think of them...
